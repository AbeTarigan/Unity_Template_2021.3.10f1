    An awesome README template to jumpstart your projects!
    <br />
  </p>
</div>

<details>
There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. 
I want to create a Unity template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.
  <summary>Here's why :</summary>
    <li> -> Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others</li>
    <li> -> You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch</li>
    <li> -> You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„</li>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This shows your technical skills as well as how much innovative you are. So be clear in telling this. Here are some tips I added.
<li>Don't tell the title of the project in first place. Because sometimes it will not highlight the project even its an interesting idea.</li>
<li>Try to start explaining the major concept which you are proposing in your project.</li>
<li>Say what are the advantages of your project and how it can be implemented for real time application.</li>
<li>If your project is already existed one still you have done the same means, here don't let the interviewer to know that's already existed one. Add the points how it can be modified or can be updated with better uses, it will show how much developing skills you have.</li>
<li>If you used any new technology in your project which is recently used in market, explain that clearly. This shows you how much updated you are in knowing the new techies.</li>

Hope these points will help you out to answer. Thank you. !

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Scripting
Unity allows you to create your own Components using scripts
Scripts let you trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input. 
Unity supports the C# programming language natively. 

Here some examples of how you can use scripts in your game:
<ol>
  <li>To receive input from the player and have a GameObject move or act based on that input.</li>
  <li>To set win and lose states which open relevant win or lose scenes to create a full game loop.</li>
  <li>To affect the components of GameObjects, such as their transform, animation, or renderer, based on other variables.</li>
</ol>
